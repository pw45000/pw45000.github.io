Hello! I am a research intern at the [Explainable and Controllable AI Lab](https://ziningzhu.github.io/research/), working with Dr. [Zining Zhu](https://ziningzhu.github.io/). Prior to joining the Explainable and Controllable AI Lab, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Ramapo College of New Jersey. 

My research broadly lies in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. I aim to develop language models that can utilize vast swathes of information to assist humans in their day-to-day lives. 

Towards this end, my current research interests are: 
- Retrieval Augmented Generation
- Nonparametric Retrieval 
- Long-context Language Modeling
