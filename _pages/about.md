Hello! I am a research intern at the [Explainable and Controllable AI Lab](https://ziningzhu.github.io/research/), working with Dr. [Zining Zhu](https://ziningzhu.github.io/). Prior to joining the Explainable and Controllable AI Lab, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Ramapo College of New Jersey. 

My research broadly lies in Artificial Intelligence, Information Retrieval, and Natural Language Processing. I aim to develop Language Models(LMs) that can utilize vast swathes of information to assist humans in their day-to-day lives. 

Towards this end, my current research interests include: 
- Retrieval Augmented Generation
- Semiparametric and Nonparametric Retrieval-based LMs (e.g. [Evaluating kNN-LM](https://pw45000.github.io/assets/pdf/interpolation_knnlm_preprint.pdf))
- Long-Context Language Modeling 
- Self-Correction in LMs
