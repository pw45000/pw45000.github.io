Hello! I am a research intern at the [Explainable and Controllable AI Lab](https://ziningzhu.github.io/research/), working with Dr. [Zining Zhu](https://ziningzhu.github.io/). Prior to joining the Explainable and Controllable AI Lab, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Ramapo College of New Jersey. 

My research broadly lies in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. I aim to develop Language Models(LMs) that can utilize vast swathes of information to assist humans in their day-to-day lives. 

Towards this end, my current research interests include (but are not limited to): 
- Retrieval Augmented Generation
- Nonparametric Retrieval Augmented LMs (e.g. [Evaluating *k*NN-LM](https://pw45000.github.io/assets/pdf/interpolation_knn_preprint.pdf))
- Long-Context Language Modeling 
- Self-Correction in LMs 

If you would like to discuss my research or colloborate, please feel free to email me!
