Hello! I am a research intern at the [Explainable and Controllable AI Lab](https://ziningzhu.github.io/research/), working with Dr. [Zining Zhu](https://ziningzhu.github.io/). Prior to joining the Explainable and Controllable AI Lab, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Ramapo College of New Jersey. 

My research broadly lies in the fields of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. My goal in research is to develop language models that can utilize vasts swathes of information to assist humans in their day-to-day lives. 

Towards this end, my current research interests are: 
- Retrieval Augmented Generation/Language Modeling
- Nonparametric Retrieval 
- Long-context Language Modeling
